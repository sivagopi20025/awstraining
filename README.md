Data Mesh
- A contemporary method for handling and organizing data in big enterprises is called Data Mesh. With Data Mesh, all data-related duties are divided among smaller teams 
called domains, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of the company, such as sales or customer behavior, rather than being handled by a single central team.

- Every domain team turns becomes a little data department, fully responsible for owning and overseeing its own data. When needed, they make it available to other members of
the organization after collecting, cleaning, storing, and processing it. Because those who deal directly with the data are the ones who know it best, this improves the 
efficiency of data administration.

Each domain team is in charge of ensuring that their data is high-quality, user-friendly, and fits the goals of the company. Data is handled like a product.
They make it simpler for various departments within the company to collaborate by establishing explicit policies and procedures for the usage of their data by third parties.

A. Domain-Oriented Data Ownership:
Imagine your organization as a large metropolis, with distinct neighborhoods standing in for various business sectors such as finance, marketing, or sales. 
Every neighborhood has a dedicated crew that handles data management. For instance, the marketing team handles marketing data, whereas the sales team handles sales data. 
These teams take care of their data from beginning to end, gathering, organizing, and sharing it, just way individuals take care of their own houses.

B. Data as a product:
Think of each collection of data as a product that you would find on a store shelf, complete with a label and usage instructions. The data product for the sales team 
might be called "Weekly Sales Report," while the data product for the marketing team could be called "Customer Segmentation Analysis." Similar to how consumers utilize
items they discover in stores, other teams may "shop" for these data products and use them to inform choices.

C. Self-service data platform:
Imagine if every neighborhood had the resources necessary to handle its data in its own toolbox. While the marketing team may utilize tools like analytics software to study
consumer behavior, the sales team may use databases or spreadsheets to arrange their sales data. Without the assistance of a central data staff, teams may operate more 
productively with these user-friendly solutions.

D. Federated computational governance:
Federated Data Governance: Picture a system of laws governing data management that is specific to each neighborhood, akin to a mini-government. While the marketing team 
may have distinct policies around their data, the sales team may have restrictions on who may access and utilize it. There may be general guidelines that are applicable
to all parties, such as maintaining the security and safety of data.


Potential benefits of implementing a data mesh
